# YAARz-riding-system
This is my semester 2 project in c++ named car riding system. It  is made by using OOP concepts.

YAARz Rider System: C++ ride-sharing app connecting passengers & drivers with secure login (driver/passenger accounts).

Book Rides: Choose destinations from predefined locations, select bikes/cars (7 models), view real-time fare calculations.

Payment Processing: Card validation (10-16 digits), PIN verification, transaction confirmation.

Complaint System: Submit feedback/view history stored in file.txt.

Ride History: Stores destination, fare, vehicle, date, IDs in customer_history.txt with search by passenger/driver ID.

Data Files: Uses driver.txt, passenger.txt, places_from_mianwali.txt, and Kms.txt for persistent storage.

Driver Features: Register vehicles, view assigned ride history.

Passenger Flow: Account creation → Destination selection → Vehicle booking → Payment → Optional feedback.

Run: Compile with g++, requires Windows (uses conio.h).

OOP Design: Classes for Transactions, Customers, Vehicles (Bike/Car), Accounts with file I/O operations and input validation.
